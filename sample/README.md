  ## Installation
  Must first have node.js installed to your computer, then install the dependencies within the package.json file.
  
  ## Usage
  The user must first download the package.json, index.js, and generateMarkdown.js files into a folder, then open a terminal within that folder location. They must then enter the command `npm install` to install the dependencies of the package.json file.
  
  ## License 
  This project is covered under the MIT license.
  
  ## Contributing
    Once the dependencies are installed, the user must enter the command `node index.js` to start the application. For each question, the user must either type out their answer or select from a list. Once every question has been answered, the terminal logs 'Success!' and the new README.md file will be generated within that same folder.
