  ## Installation
  The user must first have node.js installed to their computer, then install the dependencies within the package.json file by running the `npm install` command in their terminal.
  
  ## Usage
  Once the dependencies are installed, the user must enter the command `node index.js` to start the application. For each question, the user must either type out their answer or select from a list. Once every question has been answered, the terminal logs 'Success!' and the new README.md file will be generated within that same folder.
